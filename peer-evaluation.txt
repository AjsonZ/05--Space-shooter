What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

    I learned that one could add a Kill score constant to give extra points upon the death of the enemy.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

    I would like to apply something similar to the scoring system in the project. 
    It had a lot of potential for positive feedback for the user.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

    There are some reduntant blocks of code that were adapted from the exercises (PLAYER_HP). 
    Removing those unnecesary blocks of code would help it be more readable.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

    It was hard to tell which sections were written by you and which came from the exercise templates.
    Clearly commenting what additions you made to the code (like the collisions/ scoring system) would make the code more readable.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

    The #Confusing comment next to the Window class, I assume this was just leftover from the exercise.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

    Yes.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

    Maybe link the repositories for the templates that you pulled from. 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

    Good Job! The handling of the bullet collisions was done well, and I could not find any errors with the collisions implemented.
